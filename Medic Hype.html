		<div>During WWII first-aid dressings were covered in  the antibiotic Sulfanilamide. It is a sulfonamide antibacterial drug. Powdered sulfanilamide was used by the Allies in World to reduce infection rates and contributed to a dramatic reduction in mortality rates compared to previous wars. Modern antibiotics have supplanted sulfanilamide on the battlefield; however, sulfanilamide remains in use today, primarily for the treatment of yeast infections.</div>

		<div>During WWII the use of blood plasma was an essential component of treating wounded soldiers. When a soldier is critically wounded, blood loss is extremely dangerous. Rather than the loss of oxygen carrying red blood cells, the greatest concern is the loss of fluids which results in low blood pressure. By transfusing casualties with plasma, blood volume is maintained and blood pressure remains at a normal level, preventing shock. Because the red blood cells are removed from plasma, the need to match the blood type of the donor to the recipient is unnecessary. In addition, dried plasma can be stored for long periods of time without refrigeration and transported across great distances. Medics on the battlefield simply reconstituted the dried plasma by adding water before transfusion.
